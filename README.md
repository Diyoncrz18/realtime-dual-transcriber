# 🎧 Ecoute

Ecoute is a live transcription tool that provides real-time transcripts for both the user's microphone input (You) and the user's speakers output (Speaker) in a textbox.

## Sponsored By: Recall.ai - Meeting Transcription API

If you’re working with speech detection or transcription for meetings, consider checking out [Recall.ai](https://www.recall.ai/product/meeting-transcription-api/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=sevask-ecoute), an API that works with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and more. Recall.ai diarizes by pulling the speaker data and separate audio streams from the meeting platforms, which means 100% accurate speaker diarization with actual speaker names and speaker emails.

Ecoute is designed to help users in their conversations by providing live transcriptions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Ecoute on your local machine.

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Python >=3.8.0
- (Optional) An OpenAI API key that can access Whisper API (set up a paid account OpenAI account)
- Windows OS (Not tested on others)
- FFmpeg 

If FFmpeg is not installed in your system, you can follow the steps below to install it.

First, you need to install Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows. Open your PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
Once Chocolatey is installed, you can install FFmpeg by running the following command in your PowerShell:
```
choco install ffmpeg
```
Please ensure that you run these commands in a PowerShell window with administrator privileges. If you face any issues during the installation, you can visit the official Chocolatey and FFmpeg websites for troubleshooting.

### 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SevaSk/ecoute
   ```

2. Navigate to the `ecoute` folder:

   ```
   cd ecoute
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
4. (Optional) Configure API credentials locally.

   The safest option is to copy the example environment file and add your real API key to `.env`:

   ```
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

   Example Groq setup:

   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
   GROQ_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=whisper-large-v3-turbo
   GROQ_TRANSLATION_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
   ```

   Example OpenAI-compatible setup:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-custom-api.example/v1
   OPENAI_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=whisper-1
   ```

   You can also use `CUSTOM_API_KEY`, `CUSTOM_API_URL`, and `CUSTOM_API_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL` with the same values.

   If you prefer Python config, copy `keys.example.py` to `keys.py` and put your real values there.
   Do not commit `.env` or `keys.py`; both files are ignored by `.gitignore`.

   If you see `Invalid API Key` or `expired_api_key`, create a new provider key and replace the old value in `.env` or `keys.py`, then restart Ecoute.

   Optional tuning:

      ```
      GROQ_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL=whisper-large-v3
      GROQ_TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE=id
      GROQ_TRANSCRIPTION_TEMPERATURE=0
      GROQ_TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT=Conversation with technical terms and product names.
      ```

   Use `whisper-large-v3-turbo` for lower latency, or `whisper-large-v3` when accuracy matters more.

   A new transcript block is created only after a mic or speaker segment has been quiet for about 5 seconds. Tune that delay with:

      ```
      ECOUTE_RECORD_TIMEOUT=1.4
      ECOUTE_PHRASE_TIMEOUT=5.0
      ECOUTE_TRANSLATION_SILENCE_DELAY=5.0
      ```

### 🎬 Running Ecoute

Run the main script:

```
python main.py
```

For a more better and faster version that also works with most languages, use:

```
python main.py --api
```

Upon initiation, Ecoute will begin transcribing your microphone input and speaker output in real-time. Please note that it might take a few seconds for the system to warm up before the transcription becomes real-time.

The --api flag will use the whisper api for transcriptions. This significantly enhances transcription speed and accuracy, and it works in most languages (rather than just English without the flag). It's expected to become the default option in future releases. However, keep in mind that using the Whisper API will consume more OpenAI credits than using the local model. This increased cost is attributed to the advanced features and capabilities that the Whisper API provides. Despite the additional expense, the substantial improvements in speed and transcription accuracy may make it a worthwhile investment for your use case.

### ✅ Testing

Run the unit tests with:

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

### ⚠️ Limitations

While Ecoute provides real-time transcription and response suggestions, there are several known limitations to its functionality that you should be aware of:

**Default Mic and Speaker:** Ecoute is currently configured to listen only to the default microphone and speaker set in your system. It will not detect sound from other devices or systems. If you wish to use a different mic or speaker, you will need to set it as your default device in your system settings.

**Whisper Model**: If the --api flag is not used, we utilize the 'tiny' version of the Whisper ASR model, due to its low resource consumption and fast response times. However, this model may not be as accurate as the larger models in transcribing certain types of speech, including accents or uncommon words.

**Language**: If you are not using the --api flag the Whisper model used in Ecoute is set to English. As a result, it may not accurately transcribe non-English languages or dialects. We are actively working to add multi-language support to future versions of the program.
